# Description

SWeBLAST (Sliding Window wEb-based BLAST) is a cross-platform command line program written in Python. SWeBLAST.py splits one or more sequences into sub-sequences using a sliding window and blasts them against a local or online (NCBI) databases. Sub-sequences are saved in seq.fa and BLAST results are saved into blast.txt. The blast.txt file is parsed by SWeBLAST_parser.py, creating some summary files in comma-separated files.
