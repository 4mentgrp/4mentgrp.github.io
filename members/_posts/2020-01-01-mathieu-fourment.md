I am a lecturer in the ithree institute at the [University of Technology Sydney](https://www.uts.edu.au). I am interested in understanding the evolutionary processes that drive the evolution of pathogens. I develop phylogenetic algorithms and software to investigate natural selection, evolutionary rates, and the geographic dispersal of viruses such as influenza virus and HIV. My research is part of a bigger picture looking at ways to better manage global issues such as antimicrobial resistance and infectious disease outbreaks.
