# Abstract

**Background.** Accurate multiple sequence alignment is central to bioinformatics and molecular evolutionary analyses. Although sophisticated sequence alignment programs are available, manual adjustments are often required to improve alignment quality. Unfortunately, few programs offer a simple and intuitive way to edit sequence alignments.

**Results.** We present Seqotron, a sequence editor that reads and writes files in a wide variety of sequence formats. Sequences can be easily aligned and manually edited using the mouse and keyboard. The program also allows the user to estimate both phylogenetic trees and distance matrices.

**Conclusions.** Seqotron will benefit researchers who need to manipulate and align complex sequence data. Seqotron is a Mac OS X compatible open source project and is available from Github [https://github.com/4ment/seqotron/](https://github.com/4ment/seqotron/).
